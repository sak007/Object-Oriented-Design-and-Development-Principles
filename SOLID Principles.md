 ## Single Responsibility
  - A class should have only one reason to change.
 
 ## Open Close Principle
  - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
 
 ## Liskov Substitution principle
  - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
 
 ## Interface Segregation principle
  - Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.
 
 ## Dependency Inversion principle
  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
  - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
